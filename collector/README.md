Collector
=========

This is a scala app, built with scala's [simple build tool](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).

To build, first install any version of sbt as described [here](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html). 
Summary: on a mac, just `brew install sbt`.

Then in this directory:

```
  $ sbt
  > test:run
```

The first time you run, the internet will download. It shouldn't happen again.
