    %p Swarmize is a public repository of data for analysis and re-use.

    %p Collected by theguardian.com editors, Swarms are surveys run over a period of time - from hours to weeks. 

    %p You can see the results of Swarms in progress in real time as we receive data, right her on Swarmize.

    %p When a Swarm is over, you can explore its results, watch how they built up over time, and download CSV and JSON to use within your own applications.
