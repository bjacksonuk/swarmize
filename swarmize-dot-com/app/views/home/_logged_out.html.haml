    %p Swarmize is a data journalism platform.  It helps editors collect, analyze and output information.  
    
    %p News teams can create simple surveys in minutes or build engaging interactives and custom data collectors with front-end developers using the Swarmize toolchain.  The platform includes a survey wizard, embeddable web forms, dashboards and charts, CSV outputs and developer-friendly APIs optimized for high volume, fast-paced news organizations such as theguardian.com. 
    
    %p Swarmize does the heavy lifting behind the scenes and makes it easy to deploy and manage data journalism projects quickly and cheaply.

    %p At its most basic, Swarmize can be used to generate embeddable forms and analyse data. This case study serves as a basic tutorial for Swarmize.

    %h3= link_to "Realtime data, and going beyond embeds: using Swarmize’s Collector and Retrieval APIs to build a live ‘clicker’ for a TV debate", case_study_path('realtime_clicker')
    %p Swarmize isn't just about embeddable forms. Here, we use the Collector and Retrieval APIs (for input and output) to build a realtime 'clicker' for feedback during a TV debate.
  %li
    %h3= link_to "Real world use: the #indyref swarm", case_study_path('indyref')
    %p Finally, a real swarm commissioned by a Guardian editor at short notice: to watch how sentiment on Twitter was leaning in the run up to the Scottish Independence Referendum.
