# Examples

Examples of Swarmize usage. Examples currently include:

* `generic-backend` - the simplest possible node.js generic back-end for any Swarm.
* `livedebate` - a realtime 'clicker' to send data to the Collector, with a backend
* `livedebate-scotland` - a realtime 'clicker' to send data to the Collector, which does so directly from a flat HTML page
* `mapdemo-standalone` - retrieving data from the Swarmize Retrieval API directly from a flat HTML page
* `mapdemo-backend` - retrieving data from the Swarmize Retrieval API via a small backend, for security reasons
