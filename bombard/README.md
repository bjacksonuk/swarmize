# bombard

Bombard is a very simple/dumb ruby script for hammering a swarm (FSVO 'hammering') with hits. It was designed around a specific swarm, and contains code specific to those fields, but it should be straightforward enough to adapt it for other swarms, especially if you'd like to fill them with not-entirely-random data.

(For instance: in this swarm, an imaginary user will always specify the same plans to vote in the next election, even though who they agree with will change moment-to-moment).
