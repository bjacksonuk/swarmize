# Swarmize

Swarmize is a stack of tools to make crowd-powered number-gathering a lot easier.

Currently in this repository:

* `collector`: Receive data from an endpoint and forward it to the stream. [scala]
* `livedebate`: Sample app: click on the face you're liking most at any point during a prime ministerial debate; the data - along with some demographic information - will be pushed into Swarm. [ruby]
